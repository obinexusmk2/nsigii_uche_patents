## Abstract

This document formalizes a novel approach to derivative calculus through systematic tracing and vector
interpretation. The OBINexus Derivative Tracing System (ODTS) provides a structured methodology for
calculating, verifying, and interpreting derivatives through order-based notation and vector field analysis.

## 1. Fundamental Principles

### 1.1 The Tracing Notation System

We define a derivative order notation system where:

```
D=1 : First-order derivative (rate of change)
D=2 : Second-order derivative (change of change/curvature)
D=3 : Third-order derivative (stability threshold)
D=n : nth-order derivative
```
This notation provides clear audit trails for complex mathematical operations.

### 1.2 Vector Force Interpretation

Classical Newtonian mechanics: **F = ma**

Vector interpretation: **F =** ⟨ **m, a** ⟩

Where F represents a force vector in Cartesian coordinate system with mass and acceleration as
component vectors.

**Polar Coordinate Extension:** For displacement calculations: **F =** ⟨ **cos(θ), r** ⟩

This allows rotation-then-movement analysis in polar systems.

## 2. The Derivative Verification Protocol

### 2.1 Primary Verification Rule


For any derivative calculation D=n:

```
If result = 0: Check for mathematical errors or constant terms
If result ≠ 0: Calculation proceeds to next order
If result = undefined: System boundary reached
```
### 2.2 The Inverse Power Rule Insight

**Integration as Inverse Operation:** Integration = 1/(dy/dx)

This relationship provides immediate verification capability for derivative calculations.

**Example Verification:**

```
Forward: f(x) = x² → f'(x) = 2x
Inverse: ∫2x dx = x² + C ✓
```

**Force Field Requirements:** For force F to exist: F must have mass m and action a within the force field
domain.
